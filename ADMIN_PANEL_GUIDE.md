## 🗄️ Firestore Product Schema

Products are stored in Firestore `products` collection with this atomic schema:

```javascript
{
  "id": "auto-generated-doc-id",
  "title": "Premium Basmati Rice",
  "slug": "premium-basmati-rice",
  "description": "Long grain authentic basmati rice from India...",
  "priceINR": 299.99,
  "category": "Food",  // "Food" | "Decorative"
  "serviceType": "purchaseable",  // "purchaseable" | "parcel-only" | "both"
  "weightKg": 1.5,
  "dimensionsCm": {
    "length": 30,
    "width": 20,
    "height": 10
  },
  "stock": 50,
  "tags": ["new", "featured"],
  "images": [
    "https://res.cloudinary.com/doxwyrp8n/image/upload/...",
    "https://example.com/product-image.jpg"
  ],
  "thumbnails": [
    "https://res.cloudinary.com/doxwyrp8n/image/upload/...",
    "https://example.com/product-image.jpg"
  ],
  "createdAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-01-20T15:45:00.000Z",
  "createdBy": "firebase-admin-user-uid"
}
```

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Current Security Measures:
1. **Client-Side Guards:**
   - `useUserRole` hook checks Firestore `users/{uid}.role` field
   - Redirects non-admins to `/auth` page
   - Toast notification: "Access denied. Admins only."

2. **Role Storage:**
   - User roles stored in Firestore: `users/{uid}.role`
   - Possible values: `"admin"` or `"customer"`

3. **Image Upload:**
   - Cloudinary unsigned uploads to cloud
   - URL validation for pasted image links
   - File type validation (JPG, PNG, WEBP, GIF)

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Firestore Security Rules Required

**You MUST add these Firestore Security Rules to prevent unauthorized access:**

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Helper function to check if user is admin
    function isAdmin() {
      return request.auth != null && 
             get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
    
    // Products collection - Admins can write, everyone can read
    match /products/{productId} {
      allow read: if true;  // Public read access
      allow create, update, delete: if isAdmin();
    }
    
    // Users collection - Users can read their own data, admins can write roles
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow update: if request.auth != null && (
        request.auth.uid == userId || 
        isAdmin()
      );
    }
  }
}
```

**To add these rules:**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `venkatexpress2`
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database** → **Rules**
4. Replace existing rules with the above
5. Click **Publish**

## 🖼️ Cloudinary Integration

### Configuration:
- **Cloud Name:** `doxwyrp8n`
- **Upload Preset:** `venkat express 2`

### How it works:
1. Admin uploads image via file input
2. Client-side upload to Cloudinary (unsigned)
3. Receives `secure_url` from Cloudinary
4. URL stored in Firestore `products/{id}.images` array

### Supported Methods:
- **Method 1:** Upload from local computer
- **Method 2:** Paste direct image URL (with validation)

---

## 🌐 Frontend Integration

### Products Display:
Products added via Admin Panel **automatically appear** on:
- **Home Page** (`/`): Featured products section (first 4 products)
- **Products Page** (`/products`): Full product catalog with filters
- **Product Detail Pages** (`/product/{slug}`): Individual product pages

### Data Flow:
1. Admin adds/edits product in Admin Panel
2. Product saved to Firestore `products` collection
3. `useProducts` hook fetches products in real-time
4. `ProductCard` component displays each product
5. Dynamic rendering - no hardcoded data

---

## 👤 User Roles & Access

### Admin Users:
- Can access `/admin` route
- See "Admin" button in header (desktop) with Shield icon
- Can create, read, update, delete products
- Full inventory management access

### Regular Users (Customers):
- Cannot access `/admin` (redirected to `/auth`)
- Can browse and purchase products
- See standard user interface

### Setting Admin Role:
To make a user an admin, update Firestore:

```javascript
// In Firestore Console or via script
db.collection('users').doc('USER_UID').update({
  role: 'admin'
});
```

Or manually in Firebase Console:
1. Go to Firestore Database
2. Navigate to `users` collection
3. Find the user document by UID
4. Add/update field: `role` = `"admin"`

## 🔧 Next Steps (Recommended)

### High Priority:
1. **Add Firestore Security Rules** (see Security section above)
2. **Test with real admin user account**
3. **Add more admin users** (set role in Firestore)

### Medium Priority:
4. **Add product categories filtering** on Products page
5. **Implement bulk operations** (bulk delete, bulk edit stock)
6. **Add product import/export** (CSV functionality)
7. **Enhanced analytics** (sales tracking, popular products)

### Low Priority:
8. **Product variants** (sizes, colors)
9. **Inventory alerts** (email notifications for low stock)
10. **Order management** (track customer orders)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Access denied" even for admin
**Solution:** Check Firestore `users/{uid}.role` field is set to `"admin"` (case-sensitive)

### Issue: Images not uploading
**Solution:** Verify Cloudinary config: Cloud Name = `doxwyrp8n`, Upload Preset = `venkat express 2`

### Issue: Products not appearing on website
**Solution:** Check Firestore rules allow public read access to `products` collection

### Issue: Form validation errors
**Solution:** Ensure all required fields are filled (title, description, category, service type, price, stock, at least 1 image)
